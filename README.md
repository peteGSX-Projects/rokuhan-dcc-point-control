# Arduino Rokuhan DCC Turnout Controller
This repository contains the code for an Arduino based controller capable of switching two or four Rokuhan brand electronic turnouts using DCC for digital control.

This uses two L293D motor controller ICs or an L298 motor shield to control the turnouts.

The code complies with the NMRA standard setting direction 1 for Closed, and 0 for Thrown.
